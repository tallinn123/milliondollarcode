// If you want to convert a double to an int, for example, you must use casting.
//Casting means converting its value from one data type to another

//Casting is similar to conversion but isnâ€™t done automatically.
// You use casting to perform a conversion that is not shown.

// RISK! When you use casting, you run the risk of losing information.
//if you cast a double to an int, so 3.1415 becomes 3, for example.
